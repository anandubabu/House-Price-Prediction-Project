## Introduction

In this project, we use a dataset from Kaggle that contains information about house properties, including the area type, availability, location, size, total square footage, number of bathrooms, balconies, and price. We aim to build a machine learning model that can predict house prices based on these features.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need to:
- Import the necessary Python libraries.
- Load the dataset into your environment.
- Perform data cleaning to handle missing values and outliers.
- Explore the data to gain insights into its characteristics.
- Engineer features to improve model performance.
- Build and evaluate machine learning models for price prediction.

## Data Cleaning

Data cleaning involves:
- Removing columns that do not significantly contribute to price prediction.
- Handling missing values in the dataset.
- Extracting the number of bedrooms from the 'size' column.
- Converting data types as needed for analysis.

## Data Exploration

In this section, we explore the dataset, check for unique values, and analyze data statistics. We also calculate the price per square foot, which is a useful feature for modeling.

## Feature Engineering

Feature engineering involves transforming categorical variables into numerical features, reducing the dimension of infrequent locations, and handling outliers based on bedrooms and bathrooms.

## Building Machine Learning Models

We have trained several machine learning models to predict house prices. These models include:
- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree Regressor
- Random Forest Regressor
- AdaBoost Regressor
- Gradient Boosting Regressor
- K-Neighbors Regressor

We evaluate the models based on their R-squared (R2) scores.

## Model Evaluation

To measure model accuracy, we have employed k-fold cross-validation. We have also provided sample predictions using the Linear Regression model.

## Testing

We've included a function for predicting house prices based on input values for square footage, bathrooms, bedrooms, and location. You can test this function with different input values.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the practical application of data science and machine learning in the real estate market. It provides valuable insights for both buyers and sellers by predicting house prices accurately.
